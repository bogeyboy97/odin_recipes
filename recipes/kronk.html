    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Pkg. Puff Pastry Sheets</li>
        <li>10 oz. Frozen Chopped Spinach, thawed & drained well (squeezing by hand w/ paper towels helps)</li>
        <li>1 Cup Crumbled Feta (plain or flavored)</li>
        <li>1 Onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>Fresh Herb, like Parsley, Cilantro, or Dill, minced (optional)</li>
        <li>3 Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. Water</li>
    </ul>
    
   
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400Â°F. In a medium bowl, mix together the drained spinach, crumbled feta, chopped onion, 2 of the eggs, & the optional fresh herbs. <br>In a small bowl whisk the remaining egg with the water to create an egg wash.</li>
        <li>Roll out the puffed pastry & cut into squares, depending on the size of spinach puffs you want. 
            <br>Place a small amount of the spinach mixture onto each square, leaving space between the mixture & the edges. 
            <br>Using a clean kitchen brush, brush the edges of the puff squares, one at a time, with the egg wash. 
            <br>Next, lift one corner of a square & fold it over to the opposite corner, creating a triangle with the spinach mixture inside. 
            <br>Press the edges closed using your fingers or a fork. Repeat this process until all of the squares are triangles (or you can press 2 corners together & leave the spinach exposed). 
            <br>Move the pre-puffs to a parchment-lined baking tray & brush the tops with the rest of the egg wash. Bake for about 20 mins. or until the puffs are nice & golden with a touch of brown. 
            <br>"Watch it. They're still hot." Best served warm.</li>
